## Quote from Eileen Law:
"It started off in my little closet" at the Dead's headquarters in San Rafael, "and it kept growing and growing, and now it fills up a warehouse."

## Quote from Mickey Hart (Rolling Stone Magazine, April 1, 2010):
"If you want to know how the Dead was built, this is where you would go...the archive tells the whole story."


## History: The Band Chooses Santa Cruz

### April 24, 2008 - Official Donation Announcement

On April 24, 2008, band members Bob Weir and Mickey Hart announced at the San Francisco Fillmore press conference that the group was donating its archives to the University of California at Santa Cruz (UCSC) Library Special Collections.

**Key Points from the Press Conference:**
- Great excitement about making the archives available as a research collection and as a resource on the Internet
- The band's thirty-year history could be interpreted through educational use of archives and artifacts
- University Chancellor George Blumenthal displayed a tie-dyed T-shirt created to commemorate the occasion
- Bob Weir explained that the remaining members of the band agreed that making their collection available to the community was the right thing to do

### Why Santa Cruz?

Bob Weir: "We looked around, and UC Santa Cruz seems the best possible home. If you ever wrote the Grateful Dead a letter, you'll probably find it there!"

Mickey Hart called the decorated fan envelopes in the collection "masterpieces" showing the "love" between the band and the fans.

### Connection to UCSC

- Mickey Hart collaborated with the late UCSC Professor Fredric Lieberman on three books including Planet Drum
- Dr. Lieberman taught the course "Music of the Grateful Dead" where students discovered how the band re-envisioned and updated many of America's musical traditions, from bluegrass to jazz

### Eileen Law - Original Archivist

Eileen Law was originally hired to serve as a liaison to fans and became the band's original archivist. For over thirty-four years she saved everything.
