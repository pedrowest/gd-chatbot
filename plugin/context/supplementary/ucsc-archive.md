## History and Donation

### April 24, 2008: Official Donation

On April 24, 2008, band members Bob Weir and Mickey Hart announced at the San Francisco Fillmore press conference that the Grateful Dead was donating its archives to UC Santa Cruz Library Special Collections.

**Why Santa Cruz?**

Bob Weir explained: "We looked around, and UC Santa Cruz seems the best possible home. If you ever wrote the Grateful Dead a letter, you'll probably find it there!"

The band had a pre-existing connection to UCSC through Mickey Hart's collaboration with the late UCSC Professor Fredric Lieberman on three books, including *Planet Drum*. Dr. Lieberman taught the course "Music of the Grateful Dead," where students discovered how the band re-envisioned and updated many of America's musical traditions.

### Eileen Law: Original Archivist

Eileen Law, originally hired to serve as a liaison to fans, became the band's original archivist. For over thirty-four years she saved everything. As she described it: "It started off in my little closet" at the Dead's headquarters in San Rafael, "and it kept growing and growing, and now it fills up a warehouse."
