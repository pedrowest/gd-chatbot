Songs performed and/or released by the Grateful Dead

The songs listed below were played by the Grateful Dead. The list includes all the songs, part songs, jams, teases, etc that have been given names. A few generic entries cover unnamed jams and solos. The information button for each song leads to a list of recordings of that song by the Grateful Dead, groups related to the Grateful Dead, and, in most cases, by other groups and performers.

If a song was played at a show, soundcheck, or rehearsal either in full or in part then there will be a "Yes" in the Live column.

If a song has been included on any type of official release then there will be a "Yes" in the Released column.

The Notes column provides additional information for some of the songs. More extensive notes are usually available on the individual song pages.

There will be songs missing from this list. Ongoing research unearths previously unidentified songs and quotes within jams and these will be added to the list. Conversely a few entries on the list were possibly never played by the Grateful Dead. These are songs that appear on written lists made at shows but have never been confirmed by tapes or other attendees.

A subset of this list which shows only songs covered by the Grateful Dead is available on the songs covered by the Grateful Dead page.

Additions, corrections and comments are welcome
