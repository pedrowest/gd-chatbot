## Critical High-Priority Terms Added

### VERY HIGH RISK:
1. **GDP** = Grateful Dead Productions (NOT Gross Domestic Product)
   - Used in business/tour contexts
   - Extreme confusion risk with economic term

### HIGH RISK:
2. **The Archive** = UCSC GD Archive OR Internet Archive (not generic archive)
   - Needs disambiguation between two major archives
   - Frequently referenced

3. **Acid Tests** = Ken Kesey's LSD parties (1965-66), not chemistry experiments
   - Foundational cultural/historical term
   - Essential for understanding GD origins

### MEDIUM-HIGH RISK:
4. **The Vault** = Band's tape archive (not bank vault)
   - Referenced constantly for recordings

5. **Ram Rod** = Crew chief Lawrence Shurtliff (not truck part)
   - Legendary equipment manager

6. **Dead Heads** = Early spelling variation of Deadhead
   - Historical context important

## Testing Recommendations

### High-Priority Test Queries:

#### GDP:
- ❌ **WRONG:** "What is GDP?" → Economic data about Gross Domestic Product
- ✅ **RIGHT:** "What is GDP?" → Grateful Dead Productions (band's management company)

#### The Archive:
- ✅ "Tell me about The Archive" → Should mention BOTH UCSC GD Archive and Internet Archive with disambiguation
- ✅ "Where is The Archive?" → Should clarify which archive (UCSC in Santa Cruz, CA OR Internet Archive online)

#### Acid Tests:
- ✅ "What were the Acid Tests?" → Ken Kesey's LSD parties (1965-66), Warlocks/early Dead as house band
- ❌ **WRONG:** → Chemistry experiments or scientific tests

#### The Vault:
- ✅ "What's in The Vault?" → Band's legendary tape archive (original master recordings)
- ❌ **WRONG:** → Bank vault or video game vault

#### Ram Rod:
- ✅ "Who was Ram Rod?" → Lawrence Shurtliff, legendary crew chief and equipment manager
- ❌ **WRONG:** → Truck part, battering ram, Dodge Ram
