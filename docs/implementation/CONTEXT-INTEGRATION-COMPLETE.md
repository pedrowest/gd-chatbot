## 🎨 Why This Matters

### Before This Update
- ❌ Might confuse "Miller" with generic surnames or beer
- ❌ "Archive" could mean any archive
- ❌ "HerbiBot" might be interpreted as cannabis-related
- ❌ "Cosmic Charlie" only recognized as a song
- ❌ No understanding of Dead-specific AI tools
- ❌ Book titles confused with literal meanings

### After This Update
- ✅ "Miller" = Charlie Miller (renowned taper/engineer)
- ✅ "Archive" = Internet Archive or UCSC GD Archive
- ✅ "HerbiBot" = GD setlist and streaming platform
- ✅ "Cosmic Charlie" = Song AND/OR ChatGPT chatbot
- ✅ Understands Dead AI ecosystem (Jerry Garcia voice, chatbots)
- ✅ Recognizes book titles and can recommend literature
