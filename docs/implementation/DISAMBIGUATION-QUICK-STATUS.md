## Testing Priority

Test these ambiguous terms first:

1. "What is GDP?" → Should return Grateful Dead Productions, NOT economics
2. "Tell me about The Archive" → Should clarify UCSC vs Internet Archive
3. "What were the Acid Tests?" → Should describe Kesey's parties, not chemistry
4. "What's in The Vault?" → Should describe tape archive, not bank
5. "Who was Ram Rod?" → Should identify crew chief, not truck part
