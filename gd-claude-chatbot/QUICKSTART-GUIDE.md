## 💡 Tips for Best Results

### ✅ Do This

- **Be specific**: "Cornell 5/8/77 setlist" is better than "good shows"
- **Ask follow-ups**: The chatbot remembers your conversation
- **Use dates**: "5/8/1977" or "May 8, 1977" both work
- **Ask about anything**: Shows, songs, members, culture, history
- **Request comparisons**: "Compare 1977 vs 1989"

### ❌ Avoid This

- Don't ask multiple unrelated questions at once
- Don't expect real-time information (data ends in 1995)
- Don't ask about post-Jerry shows (focus is on 1965-1995)
