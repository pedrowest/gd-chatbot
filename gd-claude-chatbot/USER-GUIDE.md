## Tips for Best Results

### ✅ **Do This**

**Be Specific:**
- ✅ "Cornell 5/8/77" is better than "famous show"
- ✅ "Jerry's guitar in 1979" is better than "Jerry's guitars"
- ✅ "Shows in San Francisco in 1974" is better than "shows in SF"

**Ask Follow-Up Questions:**
- Build on previous responses
- The chatbot remembers your conversation
- Go deeper into topics

**Use Natural Language:**
- Ask questions like you'd ask a friend
- "What did they play at..." works great
- No need for formal language

**Try Different Phrasings:**
- If you don't get what you want, rephrase
- Ask from a different angle
- Add more context

### ❌ **Avoid This**

**Too Vague:**
- ❌ "Tell me about shows" (which shows?)
- ❌ "Good songs" (good in what way?)
- ❌ "The tour" (which tour?)

**Too Many Questions at Once:**
- ❌ "Tell me about Jerry's guitars and when they played Dark Star and the Wall of Sound"
- ✅ Ask one question at a time

**Expecting Recent Info:**
- ❌ "What are they doing next month?"
- ✅ The band ended in 1995; ask about history

**Overly Technical:**
- ❌ Database queries or complex searches
- ✅ Simple, natural questions
